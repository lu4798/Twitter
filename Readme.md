# Twitter Word Counter
App based on **Twitter's API** that counts how many times a word is tweeted by an account on its last tweets. 

Some considerations to have in mind:

- The app does not tweet, like nor retweet any content
- The app does not consider retweets nor replies in the count of the words.
- The app does not consider links as words
- The app considers hashtags as words ()
- The app does not consider stopwords
